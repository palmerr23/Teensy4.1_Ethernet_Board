# Teensy4.1_Ethernet_Board
A HandRun HR91105A MagJack board for Teensy 4.1 Ethernet

Board files are KiCAD 6.0

Gerbers should be OK for most PCB manufacturers. Note there are no ground planes.

The CASE pad should be connected to chassis ground, if one exists. Do not connect the CASE pad to Teensy GND. 

## Design is still to be tested (awaiting PCBs).
